        DC Comics, Inc. (doing business as DC) is an American comic book publisher and the flagship unit of DC Entertainment,[6][7] a
         subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery.[8][9]

DC Comics is one of the largest and oldest American comic book companies, with their first comic under the DC banner being published in 1937.
[10] The majority of its publications take place within the fictional DC Universe and feature numerous culturally iconic heroic characters, 
such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash, and Aquaman; as well as famous fictional teams including the Justice League,
 the Justice Society of America, the Teen Titans, and the Suicide Squad. The universe also features an assortment of well-known supervillains 
 such as the Joker, Lex Luthor, Deathstroke, the Reverse-Flash, Brainiac, and Darkseid. The company has published non-DC Universe-related
  material, including Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Fables and many titles under their alternative imprint Vertigo and now DC Black Label.

Originally in Manhattan at 432 Fourth Avenue, the DC Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue; 909 Third Avenue;
 75 Rockefeller Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC had its headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York 
 City, but DC Entertainment relocated its headquarters to Burbank, California in April 2015.[11]

Penguin Random House Publisher Services distributes DC Comics' books to the bookstore market,[12] while Diamond Comic Distributors supplied the
 comics shop direct market[11][13] until June 2020, when Lunar Distribution and UCS Comic Distributors, who already dominated direct market 
 distribution on account of the disruption to Diamond that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, replaced Diamond to distribute to that market.[4]

DC Comics and its longtime major competitor Marvel Comics (acquired in 2009 by The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Discovery's main competitor)
 together shared approximately 70% of the American comic book market in 2017,[14] though this number may give a distorted view since graphic
  novels are excluded. With the sales of all books included, DC is the second biggest publisher, after Viz Media, and Marvel is third.[15]
