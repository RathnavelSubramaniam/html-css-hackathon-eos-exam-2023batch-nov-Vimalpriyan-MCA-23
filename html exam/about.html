            Originally in Manhattan at 432 Fourth Avenue, the DC Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue; 909 Third Avenue;
 75 Rockefeller Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC had its headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York 
 City, but DC Entertainment relocated its headquarters to Burbank, California in April 2015.[11]

Penguin Random House Publisher Services distributes DC Comics' books to the bookstore market,[12] while Diamond Comic Distributors supplied the
 comics shop direct market[11][13] until June 2020, when Lunar Distribution and UCS Comic Distributors, who already dominated direct market 
 distribution on account of the disruption to Diamond that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, replaced Diamond to distribute to that market.[4]

DC Comics and its longtime major competitor Marvel Comics (acquired in 2009 by The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Discovery's main competitor)
 together shared approximately 70% of the American comic book market in 2017,[14] though this number may give a distorted view since graphic
  novels are excluded. With the sales of all books included, DC is the second biggest publisher, after Viz Media, and Marvel is third.[15]
